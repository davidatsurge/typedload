All contributions must pass the test suite and must generate no warnings with the latest available version of mypy.

The best way of sending changes is to use git-send-mail to tiposchi@tiscali.it

It is acceptable also to use github's pull request functionality.

Contributors must accept that their changes can use both GPL3 and LGPL3. Currently the license is GPL3 with one exception being made for the company where I work. In the future more LGPL3 exception could be made, but no other license than those will be used.
